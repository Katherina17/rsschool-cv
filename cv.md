## **About me**
I'm Kate. Many people in my surrounding are programmers that's why I decided to try programming. I have experience in photoshop and I wanted to try a similar sphere like frontend. After a month of learning, I understood that I take pleasure in frontend. In frontend you create not only a beautiful picture but also you organize a user interface.

I like the variety and simplicity of tools that frontend offers.

My goal is to practice creating convenient and understandable user interfaces, learn to apply the knowledge gained in practice and make money on it.
