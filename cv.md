## **About me**
I'm Kate. Many people in my surrounding are programmers that's why I decided to try programming. I have experience in photoshop and I wanted to try a similar sphere like frontend. After a month of learning, I understood that I take pleasure in frontend. In frontend you create not only a beautiful picture but also you organize a user interface.

I like the variety and simplicity of tools that frontend offers.

My goal is to practice creating convenient and understandable user interfaces, learn to apply the knowledge gained in practice and make money on it.

1. **Hard skills:**
    * HTML
    * CSS

2. **Soft skills:**

``` const areaOrPerimeter = function(l , w) {
 if (l==w) {
 let area = l * w;
   return area
  }
  else {
    let perimeter = 2 * ( l + w);
    return perimeter
  }  
};
```
## **Experience**

I made the simple project a few weeks ago based on layout. It was my first project. I used HTML, CSS, JS. I didn't use responsive images. All information that I learned I found at the youtube channels and MDN.
